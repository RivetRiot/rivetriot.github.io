            <h1>Leather Products</h1>
            <p>
                Every piece is handcrafted from high-quality, 5oz leather, carefully measured, cut, and hand-dyed to ensure durability and a unique finish. Each item is finished with bee's wax for added protection, enhancing both longevity and character. Sturdy hardware is securely added, creating pieces designed for long-lasting wear. Whether you're choosing from existing designs or customizing your own, every product is crafted with attention to detail and built to endure.
            </p>
            <h2>Custom Cuffs</h2>
            <p>
                Our leather cuffs are designed for both comfort and strength. Each one is shaped for a perfect fit, with customization available to match your style or specifications. Small (3/4") cuffs start at $17, while larger styles (1-1/4") are priced at $30. Custom sizes can be made upon request. Finished with durable hardware and sealed for protection, these cuffs are built to stand up to daily wear and last a lifetime with proper care.
