                Every piece is handcrafted from high-quality, 5oz leather, carefully measured, cut, and hand-dyed to ensure durability and a unique finish. Each item is finished with bee's wax for added protection, enhancing both longevity and character. Sturdy hardware is securely added, creating pieces designed for long-lasting wear. Whether you're choosing from existing designs or customizing your own, every product is crafted with attention to detail and built to endure.
